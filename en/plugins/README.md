# Install plugin dependencies

For the dependencies mentioned in the plugin introduction page, please follow these steps to install them.

1. Open your favorite terminal, such as cmd or Powershell
2. [optional/one-time] Using the official pip source in China is very slow, here we recommend using the Tsinghua source to improve the download speed, type

```powershell
pip config set global.index-url https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```

3.[optional/one-time] To upgrade your pip, type

```powershell
python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

4. To install dependency modules, type `pip install <dependency>`, e.g. if I want to install `numpy ` and `chardet` dependencies, then use the command `pip install numpy chardet`
